# TODO Highlighter for Overleaf

This script is designed to be used with a Userscript Manager such as Tampermonkey, Greasemonkey, or Violentmonkey.

Currently, it works by applying a highlight to all instances of TODO comments in the Overleaf text editor. It reloads every 0.01 ms, which may slow the computer down. If it does, change the value in the `setInterval` to something higher.
